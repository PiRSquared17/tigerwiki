This is a simple WIKI Engine with WYSIWYG Editing. It it based on LionWiki and uses the FCKEditor.
It was created because I found nowhere a really simple Wiki engine with WYSIWYG.
It is easy to install and easy to use.

WARNING: currently there are several security Problems in the Lionwiki source. I'll refactor this code in the next time.

Please read the [Installation Instruction](InstallTigerwiki.md)
